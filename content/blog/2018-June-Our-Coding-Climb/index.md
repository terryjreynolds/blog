Many successful coders have taken many years and attempts to learn to code.

How many times in your life have you attempted and failed to learn computer programming?

My answer: 5.

It took 5 attempts before I built and scaled my first coding wall.

# False Starts

My first foray was on a Commodore 64, in my high school lab, on a ‘snow day’ when school buses were cancelled due to inclement weather. Using my introductory BASIC skills, I would generate programs to make my name, or some inappropriate-for-school phrase,scroll endlessly up the screen.

After my humble high school beginnings, I took several focused runs at really learning to code.

I tried Visual Basic. Didn’t get it.

I tried Python briefly, but the demands of being a new father slowed my progress, and I lost focus.

I tried Java online through a community college. Wow, was I confused and discouraged.

I bought books on logic and algorithms. They lacked context.
I even read up on assembly language. What for? I don’t know.

The more I tried, the more coding looked to me like an impossible wall to scale. I really felt like a failure.

Life got in the way. I gave up. For a long time.

Then I went to [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). Overnight, the confusion lifted. What had baffled me for a lifetime became clear within just a few months.

I now have a solid grasp of HTML5, CSS (Flexbox and Grid), Javascript, jQuery, Bootstrap, and React. The online community at FreeCodeCamp supported me all the way. The founder, Quincy Larson,even personally responded to my email requests for advice on how I could approach teaching coding to my class of grade 3 students.

From one perspective, my path to coding success has been littered with false-starts and failures, but I no longer see it that way. I have a revised perspective. If you are an older coder, like me, you should stop beating yourself up for failures and instead start measuring and celebrating failures as small successes.

# Notable Programmers Who Struggled

In fact, my attempts at all those languages over the years were not failures at all. <p><h4><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth" target="_blank"></h4>Donald Knuth </a>says “People think that computer science is the art of geniuses but the actual reality is the opposite, just many people doing things that build on each other, like a wall of mini stones.”</p>

He’s right. Every time I tried to conquer a new computer language and ‘failed’, I found a mini stone to place into the wall that I would eventually climb. Without those first attempts, I might never have learned the craft.

Learning to code is not just scaling a wall, but also building it one stone at a time. I scale the stones that I’ve placed and those that others placed before me.

We’re not alone. Many successful coders take many years and attempts before they achieve some storied measure of success.

Take Chris Wanstrath, a co-founder of GitHub. He took 8 years and many runs at coding before achieving success.

Chris cites many ‘false starts’ along the way. At age 12, he saved his paper route money to buy a C++ book, but quickly set it aside to play soccer instead. Later, he tried Perl, but couldn’t get the hang of all the new symbols, so he set that aside to play basketball. It wasn’t until he found PHP and a sense of community in an online chat space that Chris finally traded in his high-tops and cleats for keyboard and mouse.

James Somers, a programmer from New York and contributing writer to the Atlantic, tells a similar story. Like Wanstrath, Somers also bought a “4.6-pound Beginning Visual C++ 6. [He imagined himself] working montage-like through the book, smoothly accruing expertise one chapter at a time.” Instead, Somers “burned out after a week.”

Somers continued his attempts to learn. “Remarkably I went through this cycle several times: I saw people programming and thought it looked cool, resolved myself to learn, sought out a book and crashed the moment it got hard.”

And, of course, the self-doubt set in. “For a while I thought I didn’t have the right kind of brain for programming. Maybe I needed to be better at math. Maybe I needed to be smarter.”

Eventually, he figured out that he just needed to play more to understand programming. He broke the cycle and taught himself to code by participating in the burgeoning culture of sharing that exists on the Web. In this world, “Copying is encouraged, not frowned upon [and] The neophyte programmer never has to learn alone.”

To really learn how to code, David Walsh, a popular coding blogger, in an [interview with envatotuts+](https://code.tutsplus.com/articles/an-interview-with-david-walsh--net-8731), recommends a cycle of coding, failing and fixing. To him, the best way to learn is to “Code, code, code. Experiment, experiment, experiment. Tinker, tinker, tinker. There’s no better learning experience than sitting down, failing, fixing, failing, fixing, etc.

# Never stop failing and never stop fixing. That's the recipe.

If they can do it, we can do it.

We can turn the paradigm upside-down. We can start to see our now-code failures as future-code successes, stones in the mighty coding wall, and marvel at what architecture we can achieve.

Coders are creators. We create.

We are also life-long learners. To learn, we make mistakes, and we share. We place stones for one another to climb.

In failure, we find growth (along with the scraped knees and elbows). Together we can build and climb the coding wall.
